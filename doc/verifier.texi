@node Verifier
@subsection Verifier

Verifier is created using @command{govpn-verifier} utility.

@verbatim
% govpn-verifier
Passphrase:[hello world]
$argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg$KCNIqfS4DGsBTtVytamAzcISgrlEWvNxan1UfBrFu10
$argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg
@end verbatim

First line is the verifier for the server side. Second line is for the
client -- it lacks generated public key. However you can use server's
one on the client side too.

You can check passphrase against verifier by specifying @option{-verifier}
option with the path to verifier file:

@verbatim
% govpn-verifier -verifier '$argon2d...'
Passphrase:[hello world]
true
@end verbatim

Optionally you can store plaintext passphrases on volatile memory
(memory disk, encrypted filesystem with restrictive permissions to the
file) and provide @option{-key} option.
